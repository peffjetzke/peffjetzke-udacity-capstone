# Travel App (FEND Capstone)
The FEND Capstone Travel app was a bit challenging initiall, in much the same way that Project 4 was, which was due to the reliance on webpack and having to get its version working with the various other plugins used. Due to this, I had to restarted entirely as I simply couldn't work out the errors. 

All in all, this was a good project, if not a little bit frustrating. 

## Running the Project

Running this project can be accomplished via the following commands in the terminal (do not include the quotes):

`npm start`
`npm run build-prod`

Localhost port for this is set to 8081.
